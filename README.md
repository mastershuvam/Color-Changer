# DOM-Based Color Scheme Switcher

## Description
This project demonstrates the power of DOM manipulation by implementing a dynamic background color switcher for web pages. Users can interact with buttons to change the background color, generate random colors, or reset to the default state. The project leverages core web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create a responsive, interactive, and visually appealing user interface.

## Key Features
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updates the background color based on user input.
- **Predefined Colors**: Includes options for Grey, White, Blue, and Yellow.
- **Random Color Generator**: Allows users to experience unique and unpredictable backgrounds.
- **Reset Functionality**: Reverts the background to the default state.
- **Interactive UI**: Hover effects and active button highlighting enhance user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For DOM interactions and event handling.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any of the color buttons (Grey, White, Blue, Yellow) to change the background color.
3. Use the Random Color button to apply a random background color.
4. Click the Reset button to restore the default background color.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a user-configurable color palette for more personalization.
- Save the selected background color using local storage.
- Include animations when switching colors for a smoother transition.

## Use Case
This project is ideal for learners exploring DOM-based interactions in web development, providing a hands-on example of how to create interactive and user-friendly interfaces.
